On 25 April 1945, 50 nations met in San Francisco, California for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter, which was adopted on 25 June 1945. The charter took effect on 24 October 1945, when the UN began its operations. The organization's objectives, as defined by the charter, include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; as of 2022, it has 193 – almost all the world's sovereign states.</div>

The Secretary General (or SecGen), who is appointed by the General Assembly is the head of the secretariat.</div>
                        <div class="text-infosite">The mandate of the secretariat is a wide one. Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN's second Secretary General, described its power as follows: "The United Nations is what member nations made it, but within the limits set by government action and government cooperation, much depends on what the secretariat makes it. It has creative capacity. It can introduce new ideas. It can, in proper forms, take initiatives. It can put before member governments findings which will influence their actions". The United Nations Department of Political Affairs, which has a role analogous to the ministry of foreign affairs, is a part of the secretariat. So is the Department of Peace Operations. The secretariat is the main source of economic and political analysis for the General Assembly and Security Council; it administers operations initiated by UN's deliberative organs, operates political missions, prepares assessments that precede peacekeeping operations, appoints the heads of peacekeeping operations, conducts surveys and research, communicates with non-state actors such as media and non-government organizations, and is responsible for publishing all the treaties and international agreements.</div>

Currently, in its 78th session, its powers, composition, functions, and procedures are set out in Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter. The UNGA is responsible for the UN budget, appointing the non-permanent members to the Security Council, appointing the UN Secretary General, receiving reports from other parts of the UN system, and making recommendations through resolutions. It also establishes numerous subsidiary organs to advance or assist in its broad mandate. The UNGA is the only UN organ where all member states have equal representation.</div>
                        <div class="text-infosite">The General Assembly meets under its President or the UN Secretary General in annual sessions at the General Assembly Building, within the UN headquarters in New York City. The main part of these meetings generally runs from September through part of January until all issues are addressed, which is often before the next session starts. It can also reconvene for special and emergency sessions. The first session was convened on 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall in London and included representatives of the 51 founding nations.</div>
                        <div class="text-infosite">Most questions are decided in the General Assembly by a simple majority. Each member country has one vote. Voting on certain important questions—namely recommendations on peace and security; budgetary concerns; and the election, admission, suspension, or expulsion of members—is by a two-thirds majority of those present and voting. Apart from the approval of budgetary matters, including the adoption of a scale of assessment, Assembly resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security under the Security Council's consideration.</div>
                        <div class="text-infosite">Although the resolutions passed by the General Assembly do not have the binding forces over the member nations (apart from budgetary measures), pursuant to its Uniting for Peace resolution of November 1950 (resolution 377 (V)), the Assembly may also take action if the Security Council fails to act, owing to the negative vote of a permanent member, in a case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression. The Assembly can consider the matter immediately with a view to making recommendations to members for collective measures to maintain or restore international peace and security.</div>

                        <div class="text-infosite">The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is charged with ensuring international peace and security, recommending the admission of new UN members to the General Assembly, and approving any changes to the UN Charter. Its powers as outlined in the United Nations Charter include establishing peacekeeping operations, enacting international sanctions, and authorizing military action. The UNSC is the only UN body with authority to issue resolutions that are binding on member states.</div>
                        <div class="text-infosite">Like the UN as a whole, the Security Council was created after World War II to address the failings of the League of Nations in maintaining world peace. It held its first session on 17 January 1946 but was largely paralyzed in the following decades by the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union (and their respective allies). Nevertheless, it authorized military interventions in the Korean War and the Congo Crisis and peacekeeping missions in Cyprus, West New Guinea, and the Sinai Peninsula. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, UN peacekeeping efforts increased dramatically in scale, with the Security Council authorizing major military and peacekeeping missions in Kuwait, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</div>
                        <div class="text-infosite">The Security Council consists of fifteen members, five of which are permanent: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These were the great powers that were the victors of World War II (or, in the case of the Soviet Union and the Republic of China, their respective successor states). Permanent members can veto (block) any substantive Security Council resolution, including those on the admission of new member states to the United Nations or nominees for the office of Secretary General. This veto right does not carry over into any General Assembly or emergency special sessions of the General Assembly matters or votes. The other ten members are elected on a regional basis for a term of two years. The body's presidency rotates monthly among its members.</div>
                        <div class="text-infosite">Resolutions of the Security Council are typically enforced by UN peacekeepers, which consist of military forces voluntarily provided by member states and funded independently of the main UN budget. As of November 2021, there have been 12 peacekeeping missions with over 87,000 personnel from 121 countries, with a total annual budget of approximately $6.3 billion.</div><br>

Abstention is not regarded as a veto in most cases, though all five permanent members must vote for adopting any amendment of the UN Charter or any recommendation of the admission of a new UN member state. Procedural matters cannot be vetoed, so the veto right cannot be used to avoid discussion of an issue. The same holds for certain decisions that directly regard permanent members.

                        <div  id="text-wfp-un" class="text-infosite" >The World Food Programme (WFP) was established in 1961, driven by the need to address global hunger and food insecurity. As a specialized agency of the United Nations, WFP aims to alleviate hunger and promote food security in vulnerable communities worldwide. Its foundation lies in the belief that everyone should have access to nutritious food, particularly in times of crisis and emergencies. WFP operates with the mission to provide food assistance to those in need, whether due to conflicts, natural disasters, or chronic poverty. The organization employs a comprehensive approach, combining emergency response with long-term development initiatives to build resilience and sustainable food systems.</div>
                        <div  id="text-wfp-un2" class="text-infosite" >At the heart of WFP's work is a commitment to saving lives and changing lives by delivering food assistance, nutritional support, and innovative solutions to hunger-related challenges. The organization collaborates with governments, NGOs, and local communities to address the root causes of hunger and promote self-sufficiency. WFP's initiatives extend beyond immediate food provision, encompassing nutrition programs, school feeding projects, and efforts to empower women and communities. The organization plays a critical role in responding to humanitarian crises, delivering aid to those affected by conflicts and disasters, and ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the support they need.</div>
                        <div  id="text-wfp-un3" class="text-infosite" >In addition to emergency response, WFP engages in long-term development projects that focus on building sustainable food systems, enhancing agricultural productivity, and promoting economic opportunities. Through its work, WFP strives to contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by addressing the complex and interconnected issues of poverty, malnutrition, and food insecurity.</div><br><br>
